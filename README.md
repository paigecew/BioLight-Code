# BioLight-Code
This project is for sustaining life of the marine dinoflagellate, Pyrocystis fusiformis, in a bubbler designed to also be a beautiful light source.
Will be controlled using Arduino system
Code for Arduino; set light switch on timer, run scalable DC pump (*wifi controller?*), photodiode and/or transistor to generate electricity during low-light stage.

1. Pump: will be run by as yet *unknown* motor system connected to a pump. Requires a way to control rate of airflow either remotely or on timer. 
2. Lightsource: controlled by timer 
3. Photodiode/transistor + oscillcoscope : *experimental* to determine amount of electricity can be generated by bioluminescence overnight
